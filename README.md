# AsprakEZ
Makes it easier for asprak to download and score

## How to use
Basically, you are only required to choose one script to use out of four, use `batchDownload.js` to download all uploaded files, use `removeRedDots.js` to remove all red dots/circle, use `batchAssign.js` to assign determined values to tesawal, jurnal, tesakhir, skill form once and for all.

1. Change the `Dmz` on the first line inside the file you want to use with your SHORT NAME that you've set on http://10.30.40.123/iflab/asprak/formProfile, in this case, my SHORT NAME is `Dmz`

2. Login to the "nilai" page of impulse
3. Press CTRL+SHIFT+J for Chrome users, press CTRL+SHIFT+K for Firefox users
4. Paste the whole script to the console then press enter

PLEASE NOTE, this sometimes doesn't work, so if your downloaded file names are the same, you should try to restart it, this happens because the time AJAX take to send the data to your device may vary

### Special for batchDownload.js
These messages may show up since it's trying to open multiple links at once, browsers detect it as popups, you must allow it first.
